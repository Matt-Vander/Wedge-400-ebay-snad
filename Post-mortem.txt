🔬 Wedge 400 SPI Flash Post-Mortem Report
🧾 Overview
This technical post-mortem covers four Facebook/OCP Wedge 400 switches purchased under the listing “Tested for Key Functionality.”
After forensic firmware extraction and analysis, none of the devices booted, produced UART output, or initialized PCIe. All were found to be non-functional due to missing or incomplete SPI flash firmware — including U-Boot and ONIE.

📊 Summary of Findings
| Unit # | SPI Dump Filename       | Bootloader Found | BIOS Version     | Status    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1      | `Wedge-400-1@SOIC8.BIN` | ❌ None Detected  | AMI Aptio 5.6.5  | BIOS-only |
| 2      | `Wedge-400-2@SOIC8.BIN` | ❌ None Detected  | AMI Aptio 5.12.0 | BIOS-only |
| 3      | `wedge-400-3@SOIC8.BIN` | ❌ None Detected  | AMI Aptio 5.12.0 | BIOS-only |
| 4      | `Wedge-400-4@SOIC8.BIN` | ❌ None Detected  | AMI Aptio 5.6.5  | BIOS-only |
⚠️ None of the SPI dumps contain a valid U-Boot, ONIE, or any embedded switching logic. These devices cannot POST, emit diagnostics, or act as switches in any capacity.

⚙️ Expected Boot Flow (x86 U-Boot)
Power-On  
   ↓  
SPI Flash → [ U-Boot SPL → U-Boot Proper → ONIE or OS Payload ]  
   ↓  
Serial Output (UART)  
   ↓  
PCIe Bus Init  
   ↓  
OS Load  
Per U-Boot x86 Documentation:
“The firmware is assumed to live in SPI flash mapped to FFFF_FFFF. This includes U-Boot SPL, U-Boot proper, and any optional payloads like ONIE.”
— U-Boot x86 README (https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/tree/master)


🧪 Technical Breakdown
🔧 1. Missing Bootloaders (All Units)
❌ No valid U-Boot or ONIE detected

❌ No known compressed payloads (gzip/LZMA)

❌ No SPL/init code or PCIe setup

🧼 SPI dumps show padded 0xFF blocks — consistent with sanitized firmware

🔍 2. Zero Hardware Initialization
❌ No SCM (Switch Control Module) activation

❌ No PCIe enumeration — even with RAM and NVMe installed

❌ No UART serial output

❌ Cannot load OS from SSD, PXE, or any fallback method

🔥 3. Invalid Firmware Layouts
🧩 Partial U-Boot strings and version fragments detected

🧪 Some dumps appear to be test or factory stubs

❌ No MAC address region, serial tag blocks, or ONIE payload

📉 Entropy graphs confirm lack of meaningful boot logic

🧬 Case Focus: Wedge-400-2@SOIC8.BIN
Fragments of U-Boot headers and strings found

Entropy confirms some code presence

But:

❌ No SPL routines

❌ No DRAM or PCIe init

❌ No payload or shell logic

🔇 UART is silent or produces garbage

🧠 Conclusion: Fragments ≠ Functionality. This dump is non-bootable and unrepairable without full reflash.

🟥 Misrepresentation & Shipping Violations
❌ “Key Functionality Tested” — False Claim
No unit can POST or emit console output

No firmware = no testable functions

⚠️ No ESD Packaging
Units shipped raw in cardboard

❌ No anti-static wrap, foam, or bags

🔧 Violates ANSI/ESD S20.20

📦 Excessive Return Burden
4x units × ~41 lbs = 160+ lbs return

Industrial ESD prep required to rebox safely

Packaging discarded under assumption of seller honesty

📣 Formal Request
Due to:

Missing critical firmware

Proven falsification of “tested” claim

Unsafe handling during shipment

Excessive logistical return burden

I request a full refund with no return required.

✅ Supporting Evidence:
4x SPI dumps (.BIN)

JEDEC ID readouts (e.g., W25Q128FV)

Annotated hex and entropy comparisons

Firmware offset maps and string traces

🧠 Final Remarks
These units bear all signs of hyperscaler decommissioning:

SPI flash was sanitized, as is routine for Meta, AWS, Azure, etc.

No functional logic survives to allow POST or diagnostics.

Units cannot be used in any switching role without advanced reflashing and code reconstruction.

These are bricks, not switches.
Reflashing is non-trivial. Return shipping is excessive.
The listing was materially false.

⚠️ TL;DR Summary
🛑 All 4 units are firmware-dead — no U-Boot, ONIE, or hardware init

🛠️ SPI dumps show signs of data wiping and code stubs

❌ Not “tested” — zero switching or boot capability

📦 Shipped dangerously and cost-prohibitively to return

Resolution: Full refund, no return. Evidence is conclusive.
